## How to contribute

### Ask a question :interrobang:

Browse the [documentation](https://r-spatialecology.github.io/shar/) to see if you can find a solution. Still stuck? Open an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/r-spatialecology/shar/issues) on GitHub. We'll try to do our best to address it, as questions often lead to better documentation or the discovery of bugs.

Want to ask a question in private? Contact the package maintainer by [mhk.hesselbarth\<at\>gmail.com](mailto:mhk.hesselbarth@gmail.com).

Please try to include a reproducible example using for example the [`reprex`](https://reprex.tidyverse.org) package.

### Propose an idea :bulb:

Take a look at the [documentation](https://r-spatialecology.github.io/shar/) and [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/r-spatialecology/shar/issues) list to see if it isn't included or suggested yet. If not, please open a new issue!

While we can't promise to implement your idea, it helps to:

* Explain in detail how it would work.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible.

### Report a bug :bug:

Report it as an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/r-spatialecology/shar/issues) so we can fix it. A good bug report makes it easier for us to do so, so please include:

* The content of `utils::sessionInfo()`.
* Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
* Detailed steps to reproduce the bug

Again, please try to include a reproducible example using for example the [`reprex`](https://reprex.tidyverse.org) package.

### Improve the documentation :book:

Good documentation makes all the difference, so your help to improve it is very welcome!

We use [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2), with [Markdown syntax](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/rd-formatting.html), for documentation.

### Pull request process :arrow_up_down:

We try to follow the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) for development.

1. Fork [the repo](https://github.com/r-spatialecology/shar) and clone it to your computer. To learn more about this process, see [this guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/). Don't forget to pull all new changes before starting to work!

2. Open the RStudio project file (`.Rproj`) and install all development dependencies with (e.g., using `devtools::install_dev_deps()`). Make sure the package passes R CMD check by running `devtools::check()`.

3. Create a new Git branch and use a name that briefly describes the proposed changes.

4. Make your changes:
    * Write your code.
    * Test your code (bonus points for adding unit tests using the [`testthat`](https://testthat.r-lib.org) package).
    * Document your code (see function documentation above).
    * Check your code with `devtools::check()` and aim for 0 errors, warnings and notes.
5. Commit and push your changes.
6. Submit a [pull request](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#making-a-pull-request).

New code should follow the tidyverse [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org).
