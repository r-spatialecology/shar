\description{
Pattern reconstruction of a pattern marked by multiple traits.
}
\details{
A novel approach carries out a pattern reconstruction of marked dot patterns
as described by Tscheschel and Stoyan (2006) and Wiegand and Moloney (2014).

One particular feature is the simultaneous consideration of both marks,
accounting for their correlation during reconstruction.

The marked point pattern (PPP object) must is currently structured as follows:
X-coordinate, Y-coordinate, metric mark (e.g. diameter at breast height),
and nominal mark (e.g. tree species).It is calculated in the unit metre [m].

A combination of the mark correlation function and pair correlation function
is used for pattern description. Additional summary statistics may be
considered.Two randomly selected marks are chosen in each iteration, and one
of various actions is performed. Changes will only be retained if the
difference between the observed and reconstructed pattern decreases
(minimizing energy).

This method is currently only suitable for homogeneous point patterns.

A comprehensive description of the method can be found in Wudel et al. (2023).
