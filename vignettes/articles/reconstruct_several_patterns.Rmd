```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

In case you want to reconstruct several patterns at once (e.g. for different points in time if repeated censuses are available), you can use the following code. Please be aware that the maximum number of iterations was set to `max_runs = 10` to keep the computational time low for this example. For an applied case, this value should be increased.

```{r load-packages, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(shar)
library(spatstat)
library(terra)
```

In case you want to only create the spatial characteristics, this is straightforward using `lapply()`. 

```{r several-patterns}
# create list with patterns
list_pattern <- list(species_a, species_b)

# reconstruct all patterns in list
result <- lapply(list_pattern, function(x) reconstruct_pattern(pattern = x, n_random = 3, 
                                                               max_runs = 10, verbose = FALSE))

```

The result will be a nested list including all *m* randomization (including the observed pattern) of the *n* provided input patterns. 

```{r result-spatial}
# get mean energy
lapply(result, function(x) calculate_energy(pattern = x,
                                            verbose = FALSE))
```

Another possible would be to first reconstruct *n* times the spatial characteristics and afterwards reconstruct the marks *m* times for each of the *n* spatial reconstructions.

Firstly, reconstruct only the spatial characteristics *n* times. The observed pattern is not needed in this case, so you can put `return_input = FALSE`.

```{r reconstruct-pattern}
# reconstruct spatial strucutre
reconstructed_pattern <- reconstruct_pattern(species_a, n_random = 3, 
                                             max_runs = 10, return_input = FALSE,
                                             verbose = FALSE)
```

Secondly, to reconstruct the (numeric) marks of the observed pattern for each of the spatially reconstructed patterns, just use `lapply()` in combination with `reconstruct_pattern_marks()`.

```{r reconstruct-marks}
# get only selected marks of input (numeric marks)
species_a_marks <- subset(species_a, select = dbh)

# reconstruct marks 3 times for each input pattern
result_marks <- lapply(reconstructed_pattern$randomized, 
                       function(x) reconstruct_pattern_marks(pattern = x, 
                                                             marked_pattern = species_a_marks, 
                                                             max_runs = 10,
                                                             n_random = 3, verbose = FALSE))
```

Again, the result is a nested list with the same dimensions as provided input patterns and reconstructions.

```{r result-marks}
# get energy
lapply(result_marks, function(x) calculate_energy(pattern = x, 
                                                  verbose = FALSE))
```
