Species-habitat associations are present if species are specialized to small-scale environmental conditions (Tilman & Pacala, 1993) and are more common within suitable habitats (Comita et al., 2007; Harms et al., 2001). Following, species-habitat associations show the importance of abiotic processes on the spatial patterning of plant populations (Garzon-Lopez et al., 2014).

There are mainly two methods that can be found in the literature to analyse such small-scale species-habitat associations, namely the gamma-test (Plotkin et al., 2000) and the torus-translation test (Harms et al., 2001). Both methods require data on the locations of plants (as `spatstat::ppp` point pattern) and on the environmental conditions (classified into discrete habitats as `terra::rast`). To show significance species-habitat associations, both methods randomize one of the components. Because the locations of plants as well as the habitats are most likely auto-correlated, the spatial structure must be kept while randomizing the data (Wiegand & Moloney, 2014).

All methods compare the abundance within a habitat between the observed data and the randomized null model data. If the count is below or above a pre-set threshold (e.g. the 2.5th and 97.5th quantiles), negative or positive associations, respectively, are present.

```{r overview-methods, echo = FALSE, out.height = "100%", out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center"}

```

## Randomize environmental data

The following two methods randomize the environmental data, i.e. the SpatRaster data, while keeping the point pattern data fixed.

### Torus-translation-test
The torus-translation test (Harms et al. 2001) shifts the habitat map in all four cardinal directions around a torus. This is only possible for square rasters. To use this method in **shar** use `translate_raster()`.

### Randomized-habitats procedure
The randomized-habitats procedure (Harms et al. 2001) is also possible for non-square raster and randomizes the habitats using a random-walk algorithm. To use this method in **shar** use `randomize_raster()`.

```{r random-walk, echo = FALSE, out.height = "35%", out.width = "35%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("random_walk.gif")
```

## Randomize point pattern data

Contrastingly to the two methods described above, the following two methods randomize the point pattern data, while keeping the environmental data fixed.

```{r gamma-vs-reconstrution, echo = FALSE, out.height = "75%", out.width = "75%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("gamma_vs_reconstruction.png")
```

### Gamma-test
The gamma-test (Plotkin et al. 2000) randomizes the data by fitting a point process model to the observed data and simulation n random point patterns using the fitted point process model. However, the method only works for point patterns that can be described by a theoretical point process model. To use this method in **shar** use `fit_point_process()`.

### Pattern reconstruction
Pattern reconstruction (Tscheschel & Stoyan 2006) randomizes the point pattern using simulated annealing (Kirkpatrick et al. 1983). This allows to randomize also complex point patterns without a theoretical point process model. To use this method in **shar** use `reconstruct_pattern()`.

```{r pattern-reconstruction, echo = FALSE, out.height = "75%", out.width = "75%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("pattern_reconstruction.gif")
```
